## Emoji Mood Mapper
## Description
The Emoji Mood Mapper is a simple Python application that analyzes the sentiment of user input and maps it to an emoji. It uses TextBlob for sentiment analysis, categorizing the input as "Very Positive," "Positive," "Neutral," "Negative," or "Very Negative." Each sentiment category is associated with a corresponding emoji, offering a fun and visual representation of how users are feeling.

Additionally, the app saves mood data (text, sentiment, and emoji) to a JSON file, creating a history of previous mood assessments. Users can also provide feedback on whether the emoji accurately represents their mood.
